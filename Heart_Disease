Prevent Heart Disease:
Prevent mitochondrial damage-> avoid seed oils, fructose, starchy items, man made chemicals


Prevent Calcium Build up (atheroscelosis):
Take in true vitamin C (not ascorbic acid)
D3 and k2

Reverse calcium build up:
veinesco, vascular rejuvination -> reverses calcium build up esp by attacking nanobacteria

Why does cleaning up diet reverse heart disease in soem people? 
  Arterial calcification is when bacteria or abrasions are packed over with cholesteral/calcium plaqes (because their wasnt enough vitamin c) 
  Individuals who attack the source of the bacteria which is leaky gut or gum infection that allow bacteria to enter blood streamm, then no longer have bacteria to attack and can stop and reverse calcifying
