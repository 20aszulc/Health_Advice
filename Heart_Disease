Prevent Heart Disease:
Prevent mitochondrial damage-> avoid seed oils, fructose, starchy items, man made chemicals


Prevent Calcium Build up (atheroscelosis):
Take in true vitamin C (not ascorbic acid)
D3 and k2

Reverse calcium build up:
veinesco, vascular rejuvination -> reverses calcium build up esp by attacking nanobacteria

Bacterial Role in Calcium build up:
Veillonella and Streptococcus were the most abundant microbiota found in plaque
Studies have shown that mice, whose immune systems were compromised in such a way that they could not detect bacteria, were resistant to atherosclerosis, leading researchers to suspect that arterial plaque forms partly due to the body's immune reactions to bacteria.

Ley and colleagues found a positive correlation between amounts of bacteria and leukocytes (white blood cells) in arterial plaque, supporting the theory that higher levels of arterial plaque lead to an immune response and inflammation.

Also, Chryseomonas bacteria were found in all samples of atherosclerotic plaque, 

Why does cleaning up diet reverse heart disease in soem people? 
  Arterial calcification is when bacteria or abrasions are packed over with cholesteral/calcium plaqes (because their wasnt enough vitamin c) 
  Individuals who attack the source of the bacteria which is leaky gut or gum infection that allow bacteria to enter blood streamm, then no longer have bacteria to attack and can stop and reverse calcifying

Reversing leaky gut -> eat intestines of other animals. Zinc, L glutamine, 

Nitric Oxide Role:
Nitric Oxide facilitates vasodilation, the process by which blood vessels relax and widen, leading to increased blood flow. Prevents platlet clumping
Nitric Oxide relaxes blood vessels
