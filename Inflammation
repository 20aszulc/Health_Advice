Okay:
Fructose causes inflammation. You can only take in about 5g of fructose. HOWEVER FRUIT IS THE ONLY SOURCE that won't cause allergic/inflammation reaction on the body. 
Fructose (and vomiting) also causes teeth to rot out
Signs of reaction: This can be high blood pressure, allergies, etc...
Eating vegetables can cause allergic reaction onto the body

Immune response to a oxidative stress, pathogen, or food:
Stuffy nose, high blood pressure, weight gain, stomach pain, depression, watery/dry eyes, thyroid being attacked by cruciferous veggies

Way to resolve this is to just go carnivore. 
HOWEVER, you need plants due to vitamin C and feeding good gut bugs to live and have good heart health. Its confusing.
Carnivore - being in ketosis - can reverse cancer.
You should always be on a keto diet due to immune condition. Insulin levels should not be high. Eat FAT instead of carbs. Aboid starchy tubers.

Reducing Acne Inflammation:

Sunlight -> kills pathogenic bacteria and enables good bacteria to populate on the face.
