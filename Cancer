Cancer is
Cell having mitochondria revert to anciet energy pathways that don't utilize oxygen in atp production. Instead require glucose/glutathione

Why our ancestors didn't have cancer:
Their GKI's were below 2 -> their glucose mml/ ketone was below 2.
Fasting frequently allowed body to get rid of malformed protein and also metabolize ketones instead of glucose9
Didn't have as many carcinogens like heavy metals, toxic fume, dna damage inflammation, pesticides that lead to malfunction of cells

How to fight cancer:
High heat as tumors can't dissicpate heat as fast
high oxygen as increase our metabolism. Hyperberic oxygen-> reactive oxygen
Alkalinize env around tuomr as tumor by pr
GEt rid of glutatione and glucose as source of energy -> extended fasting provides body with ketones and fat as storage instead of glucose
