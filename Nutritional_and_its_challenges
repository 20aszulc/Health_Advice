These might be the foods causing your gut inflammation (acording to ocscar patel):
processed foods, gluten, a1 dairy, antinutrients
Phosyic acid, lectins, oxylates -> in nuts, leafy greens, legumes, soy, seeds

HIGH LECTINS:
    Sunflower
    Chia
    Peanuts
    Cashews
peas, beans, soy, edamame,beans
goji, eggplant, cucumber, zuccini, squash, pumpkin, melon, tomatoes, bellpepper, chili pepp
Lectins unique ability to increase the permeability of your intestines. 

Heal gut: Every morning drink bone broth. Carrots bind to endotoxins

Egg yolk is most bioavailable form of biotin. Consume more egg yolk

Foods for improvement(all must be low histamine, low/no sugar)
Akkermansia growing
Polyohenols
Ellagic acid -> chestnuts (750), pecans
, catachins
Agave, onion, garlic, leek, brussel sprouts, okra, califlour, broccoli, chicori root, ews cabbage

low oxylate, phalates, lectins
arugula
asparagus
box choy
broccoli
brussel sprouts
cauliflour
mushroom
radish
onion
lettuce
seaweed
bifidobacterium animales

===================
Highest micronutrients:
We find that the top sources of priority micronutrients are organs, small fish, dark green leafy vegetables, bivalves, crustaceans, goat, beef, eggs, milk, canned fish with bones, mutton, and lamb. Cheese, goat milk, and pork are also good sources, and to a lesser extent, yogurt, fresh fish, pulses, teff, and canned fish without bones.

=========

Bifidobacterium growing:
Inulin, fructose-oligosaccharide (FOS), and galactose-oligosaccharide (GOS)
GOS->pistachios, hazelnut, almonds, hummus, cow milk
GOS was effectively used by L. rhamnosus and L. reuteri for energy and growth promotion. L. casei and L. paracasei fully metabolized inulin

Lactobacillus growing:
Chicory root (inulin)

Brain growth

High Quercetin
Red onion
Kale
Watercress

Feeding good oral bacteria

High vitamin c:
Acerola cherries
Chives
Rose hips
currents
-------------------------------------The Challenges-----------------------------------------
How to stop sugar cravings (techniques):
Stop insulin resistance with IF and Keto
Stop grains and breads
Get all nutrients needed for life
Attacking bad microbiome (below) and supporting good
Get more amino acids
Increase B vitamins -> take inositol (comes from bees) as powder. It helps you get off of sugar because it reduces fatty liver related bile back up

Overreating:
Plant based lectins bind to our leptin receptors which make you hangrier ->cashews, beans, corn, tomato, potato
Avacados are high fat, low carb and NO LECTINS.
Gluten represes leptin
No Lectins->
Replace Lectins with -> with Macademia nuts, cilantro, tumeric, A2 ONLY dairy
Nutrutiional deficiencies esp in magnesium, calcium and vitamin D cause over eating! Get enough fatty acids, fiber, micronutrients, and amino acids!!!!
Overreating and binge eating was always a nutritional deficiency this entire time!!!!! Caused by an underlying infection preventing utilization of minerals esp iron.


Microbiome species:

Bacterial species that induce sugar dravings
    Firmicutes
Proteobacteria like e coli
streptococcus mutans (causee cavities)
   How to target streppococus mutans
Clostridium difficile

Bacterial species that reduce sugar craings
Akkeromansia - increase through ingesting polyphenols
Bacteroidetes - 
Fixing sugar cravings -> KETO, IF

Sugar cravings- > if candida related use candida protocol
Then use eating fat as a replacement for sweet -> Avacados, macademia nuts, yogurt, eggs, dairy, pistachios
Binging sessions should be of fat and not carbs

 Fuckign hate candida -> excess fatigue, bloating, GI irregularities, moodiness, and brain fog,
