Focal Microbiome:
Oral: 
Bad
Streppacacus mutants -> kill with Xylitol
Kill with Specifically Targeted Antimicrobial Peptides (binds to competence stimulating peptide)
Brush and floss
Promoting silivia production with fruit and vegetables
LActobacillus inbit it 
antimicrobial peptide called C16G2 kills it
C16G2, which is now delivered via a gel tray, is being developed for use in preventing tooth decay and cavities under an investigational new drug application with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration by Los Angeles-based 
C3 Jian -> did not come to fruition
Despite mouthwash killing strep. It makes mouth more acid and kills mostly good bacteria. This leads to higher stalic blood pressure, lower nitric oxide, and growth of more bad bacteria

Good oral biome -> Avoid acid and mouth washes
Streptoccocus salvarious
Lactobacillus Rheteri -> 
Streptoccocus salvarious K12-?
A12 -> hydrogen peroxide, ammonia (bleach) prevent strep from making biofilms

Gingivitus -> kill with sodium flouride

Gut microbiome to reduce inflammation:
Lactoabacillus rheteri -> combat sibo
Lactobacillus plantarum -> reduce inflammation
Bifidobacterium bifidum -> reduce intestinal permeability
Ferrocalm - > FX856 strains reduce stomach cramps, bloating, diarrhoea and constipation
Labs Microbiome -> spores???

Mood requlation:
Lactobacillus helveticus -> increase serotonin production
