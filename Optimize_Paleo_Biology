Our brains and bodies are maximized by living a paleo lifestyle
The agriculture and high wheat consumption upended and damaged our original health. Go back to our paleo roots in a way that maximizes performance

Eating tubers, fiberous foods and predominatly fish and animal foods.
Eating no processed foods, or highly glycemic foods -> this will cause mass inflammation
Abundant amount of excercise
Dynamic and vibrant social circles -> complex social systems is what maintains brain health
Fruit was to make one dumb and slow and fat for winter
Heating and cooking our plant foods for faster digestion is what allowed us to increase brain size
Never had indoors. They were always outdoors (I cant do that lol). Means cold and hot exposure, and sunlight also better air quality and no mold problems
