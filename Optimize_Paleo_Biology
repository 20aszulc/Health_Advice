Eating tubers, fiberous foods and predominatly fish and animal foods.
Eating no processed foods, or highly glycemic foods -> this will cause mass inflammation
Abundant amount of excercise
Dynamic and vibrant social circles -> complex social systems is what maintains brain health
Fruit was to make one dumb and slow and fat for winter
Heating and cooking our plant foods for faster digestion is what allowed us to increase brain size
Never had indoors. They were always outdoors (I cant do that lol). Means cold and hot exposure, and sunlight also better air quality and no mold problems
Why do we have trichromatic vision? -> so we can see the colors of fruits and veggies. Also why we need to consume vitamin C externally. 
  Why our teeth crunch and why our guts have bacteria and ability to digest fiber
