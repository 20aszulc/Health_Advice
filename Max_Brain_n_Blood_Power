Omega 3s maximize brain power
Glutamine is a good source of energy your brain can use as a boost and is in 60% of amino acids used
Brain is 75% water
How much oxygen gets to the brain is a VITAL contributor to brain function

Lactic acid build up in blood:
Can be due to cancer or fungi byproduct
can be due to vitamin B deficiency -> slow circulation from excess lactic acid (sometimes excess hemoglobin) forces the heart to beat faster to speed circulation 
Why can I feel my heart beat so fast? -> lactic acid build up slows down blood flow so heart has to beat faster.

Low Hemoglobin:
Iron, Folate deficiency, b12 deficiency
Anemia of inflammation (fighting infection, immune disease)

Ways to Maximize Oxygen to the brain:
Phenomenal Heart Health

Optimize Cardiovasular:
Must regularly be in ketosis state to clean up calcification
Eliminate all non-excercise related lactic acid build up -> pathogens build up lactic acid in the blood as a by producrt. This creates headaches and muscle soreness
