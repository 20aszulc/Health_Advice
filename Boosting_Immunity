This is about boosting immunity to kill candida and other pathogens

Immunity:
Saccomyces bouldarri boosts immunity and is resistant to antibioitcs

SIBO
Killing phase: Orange peel exact, guar gum, L rheteri, digestive enzymes, vitamin c, berberine, oregano/thyme, clove
High dose is more antimicrobial
Prokinetic: Turkey rheubarb, bitter orange
Repopulate: Colostrum


UTI
L. rhamosus, D mannose, bearberry, uva ursi,  cranberry,garlic,  Lactobacillus rhamnosus GR-1®, Lactobacillus reuteri RC-14®12 and Lactobacillus crispatus

Cold:
Garlic, Echinacea, Vitamin C 1000mg, Elderberry, oregano, esxcercise

VIRAL
Vitamin D and Vitamin C ( 1000mg) and Zinc
garlic
Antioxidants
Fasting -> How much boost, how to do, how to ovecome craving. Never finish on carbs. 
reishi (Ganoderma lucidum) and shiitake > contain polysaccharides that have been reported to enhance NK cell activity through various pathways.
 L. acidophilus and Bifidobacterium breve increase the activity of Natural Killer cells and enhance their activation
riboflavin -> 4.07 log reduction in viral growth
β-glucan can directly inhibit and disrupt the virus particles -> comes from nutritional yeast
Lactiplantibacillus plantarum nF1 (HT-nF1) increases immune cell activation and the production of various immunomodulators (e.g., interleukin (IL)-12) as well as immunoglobulin (Ig) G, which plays an important role in humoral immunity, and IgA, which activates mucosal immunity
Lactobacillus casei increased the survival rate of mice infected with influenza virus strain H3N2 and reduced the amount of virus in the lungs

Histamine:
Nasal congestion, nausa, headaches, itchy, rashes, puffy or fluid retention ONLY in areas of extra histamine (like my stomch)
IBS could be producing extra histamine ONLY in areas where injry occured to ward against future injury. Thus bloating (fluid) in stomach.

Chelators:
Spirulina, chloypyl, chorella, humic and fuvic acid (top tier)
