This is about boosting immunity to kill candida and other pathogens

Immunity:
Vitamin D and Vitamin C and Zinc
Fasting -> How much boost, how to do, how to ovecome craving. Never finish on carbs. 
reishi (Ganoderma lucidum) and shiitake > contain polysaccharides that have been reported to enhance NK cell activity through various pathways.
 L. acidophilus and Bifidobacterium breve increase the activity of Natural Killer cells and enhance their activation
riboflavin -> 4.07 log reduction in viral growth
Î²-glucan can directly inhibit and disrupt the virus particles -> comes from nutritional yeast
Lactiplantibacillus plantarum nF1 (HT-nF1) increases immune cell activation and the production of various immunomodulators (e.g., interleukin (IL)-12) as well as immunoglobulin (Ig) G, which plays an important role in humoral immunity, and IgA, which activates mucosal immunity
Lactobacillus casei increased the survival rate of mice infected with influenza virus strain H3N2 and reduced the amount of virus in the lungs
