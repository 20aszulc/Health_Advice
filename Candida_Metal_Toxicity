This is about boosting immunity to kill candida and other pathogens

Immunity:
Vitamin D and Vitamin C and Zinc
Fasting -> How much boost, how to do, how to ovecome craving. Never finish on carbs. 


Underlying Candida is Toxicity!!!
Why does my candida keep on coming back? -> some form of reoccuring death is occuring in my bowels
This can be due to heavy metal toxictiy.
Candida is a yeast that you fight by taking antifungals, biolfim disruptors, saccomyreces bouldari. 
Then  re populating good bacteria in the gut with visibiome or the like and with prebiotics (fibers)

At home treatment for mercury toxicity:
Nacetyl cysteine
Chollera
Cilantro (onion, and sulferous cruciferous vegetables)
make more glutathione
Take on empty stomach:
EDTA (low effectiveness, possbily dangerous)
Zeolite and activated charcol.

Only a functional medicine doctor will check for medal toxicity -
Chelation Therapy wiht an activator ahead of time is the only way to get them out
Chollera will only bind to mercury in the gut (not anywhere else)
Diabestes, overweight, cogintive disabilites -> all are symptoms of toxicity exposure, especially heavy metals. Can also be pesticides or GMO foods 
DSMA removes mercury so does EDTA
YOU HAVE TO DO A COURSE OF CHELATION BECAUSE WE ARE SURROUNDED BY CHEMICAL EXPOSURE
Without chelation you can do: 
You can try glutathione iv, vitamin C, N acetyl-cysteine, alpha lipolic acid, selenium
Ozone therapy

How to get a doctor to listen to you - 
the younger, female and nurse practicioners are more likely to listen to you
refrence your pain in how it affects a man's life  or a ability to show up or do work at company's productivity
      (like couldnt cook or clean for husband)
       Couldnt do dishes or have sex.
Even better if you bring a man in and get him to tell the doctor ur experience
Refrence how pain comes and goes with refrences how you need mobility support
refremce how it interfers with work 
treat with the seriousness of a crisus
Middle of the night pain causes crying  effecting sleep of others
Pay for a 2nd person to show up and advocate for your issues
Put your clothes back on before talking to a professional
